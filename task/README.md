# Task: GeoNames API

## Practical Outcomes
The brief for this task was to make use of three GeoNames APIs, found here: [https://www.geonames.org/export/ws-overview.html](https://www.geonames.org/export/ws-overview.html).

## Deployment
The live site is deployed at [www.seankennelly.com/task](www.seankennelly.com/task).

## Features
This site offers three GeoNames APIs:
- Access Country Code and Currency Code from dropdown list options
- Find the nearest country to given coodinates
- Find the timezone information for given coodinates

## Issues
One potential issue is that it is hard to predict which coodinates will reveal a result for the second and third APIs. This issue is not related to my app, as the results have been compared with the GeoNames data. The nature of coordinates mean that some guesswork is needed to make use of them. 

## Technologies
This site makes use of:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- PHP
- Bootstrapp CSS
